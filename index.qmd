**ABSTRACT**

Modern biological research is increasingly data-intensive, leading to a growing 
demand for effective training in biological data science. 
In this article, we provide an overview of key resources and best practices 
available within the Bioconductor project - an open-source software community 
focused on omics data analysis. This guide serves as a valuable reference for 
both learners and educators in the field.
